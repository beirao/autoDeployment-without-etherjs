# AutoDeployment_without_brownie_deprecated

The goal was to deploy, publish on etherscan and fund with LINK the Bet contract from the [Decentralize-foot-bet](https://github.com/beirao/backend-decentralize-foot-bet) project.

Replaced by its Brownie [version](https://github.com/beirao/autoDeployment-decentralize-foot-bet)
